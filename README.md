# modul8
This is a modulator demo program, written in C++, utilizing the Dear ImGui graphics library with SDL backend.
This demo provides an interactive platform for experimenting with various modulation and demodulation techniques, including ASK, FSK, PSK, and QAM, while simulating an AWGN channel to observe its effects on the output. The program also provides real-time visualizations of the constellation diagram, input/output bit streams, and modulated/demodulated data.

Currently only supporting Linux-x86 and WebAssembly targets.
